                    ①	Be sure to turn power off before working.<p/>
                    ②	Keep your hands clean to prevent boards from being stained with oils or water. If you need to grasp the board, please hold around the board. Be sure not to touch the contacting surface of electric parts or pattern, and especially connector.<p/>
                    ③	Align the electric potential between the body (hand) of the user and the controller.<p/>
                    ④	Each board has a number of connectors. Be sure to insert completely to prevent false inserting, omission, or looseness when replacing. Match the printed names on the nameplate of connector and on the one of boards.

                    ①	If the main board needs to be replaced, backup files of programs / constant data should be first made by using the HR-VIEW S/W of a PC (or a notebook) or a USB memory before replacing it.<p />

                    ②	Since the teaching-program / constant data is stored in SRAM of main board, the previous program / constant data you want is not existed after replacement. <p />

                    ③	After replacement, load the backup contents to the new board before using. Program/constant data remains in SRAM by the battery for backup even when power is removed. <p />

                    ④	Besides, in a case in which the connectors of a battery for backup have been separated by mistake or because of the replacement of the board, the capacitor for backup maintains programs / constant data for up to about seven days. The battery for backup must be connected to keep the board for long period of time because program/constant data may be deleted afterwards.
